KEYLOGGER:

This script uses the `pynput` library to create a simple keylogger that listens for keyboard events and logs the keys pressed into a file named `keyfile.txt`.

Features:

- Logs all key presses, including special keys (e.g., `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`) and regular characters.
- Appends key press data to a file, ensuring persistent logging across multiple runs.
